The Colosseum is situated just east of the Roman Forum. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in AD 72[2] and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus.[3] Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (81â€“96).[4] These three emperors are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named in Latin for its association with their family name"
